Together, the hippocampus and the EC contribute to the encoding of declarative and spatial memory. In the hippocampus, place cells (a type of pyramidal neurons), so called as they fire action potential when an animal is located in a distinct region of space (the place field of the cell), are thought to generate cognitive maps, as hypothesised by Edward Tolman. In 2005, Moser et al. discovered the existence of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Grid cells can be described as a type of place cells characterised by regular patterns in their spatial activity. They represent a rhomboidal grid-like structure of place fields that repeat at regular intervals.
