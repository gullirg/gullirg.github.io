The aim of the present dissertation is to clarify in an etymological, semantic and conceptual manner the generic concept of consciousness.\
Starting with the question \'93what is consciousness?\'94 the main problem is then broken down into minor issues represented by the questions:\
1. What does one refer to with the word \'93consciousness\'94?\
2. Is the term \'93consciousness\'94 unique and unambiguous? If so, which different connotations occur?\
3. Which areas of knowledge deal with the theme of consciousness and which different prospectives do they offer?\
4. How did the concept of consciousness evolved through the history of thought and the history of science? Which elements determined its main turning points?}
