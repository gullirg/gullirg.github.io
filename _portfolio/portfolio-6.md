One of the greatest differences, if not the greatest, between human beings and the rest of the animal world is the semiotic ability, i.e. the faculty of transforming the magmatic reality revealing itself in front of our eyes into compact, well defined concepts. From the chaotic and incredibly dense state of the primordial singularity, or the \'91Big Bang\'92, to the expected heat death, or \'92Big Rip\'92, the human species made its appearance in an entropic miracle where the ontologically identical components of reality assembled themselves in a meaningful and manyfold reality where complex systems could generate emergent properties and behaviour, adding new dimensions to the phase space of this reality.}
