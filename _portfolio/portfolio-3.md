In the present review we analyse the key features of cells, seen fundamentally as information processing machines. Even though the comparison between cells and machines or cells and computers provides a powerful tool for understanding how information is stored and processed by the cellular machinery, a series of misleading and simplistic assumptions are critically reviewed. Moreover, the seminal studies on understanding and artificially recreating the neuronal structure are analysed, both for exploiting its powerful computational abilities in information processing devices and for providing medical solutions to neurodegenerative diseases, neurological trauma and neuroprosthetics.
