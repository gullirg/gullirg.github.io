I have a BA in Philosophy from the San Raffaele University in Milan, a BSc in Theoretical Physics from King's College London and I'm pursuing an MSc in Machine Learning at UCL. I've also been an Undergraduate Research Fellow at King's College London, for which I was awarded the Research Excellence Award. I worked as a Summer Material Analyst Technician at Fermilab. I've been a summer intern at the Burak Lab in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. While studying Physics I've founded a startup - Mappin Technologies - with two friends. Our startup was part of the Kings20 and the Geovation accelerator cohorts.

What I'm the most passionate about is understanding how the human thought and consciousness can arise from the brain's matter.
